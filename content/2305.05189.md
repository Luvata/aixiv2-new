# [SUR-adapter: Enhancing Text-to-Image Pre-trained Diffusion Models with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05189)

Authors: Shanshan Zhong, Zhongzhan Huang, Wushao Wen, Jinghui Qin, Liang Lin

Abstract: Diffusion models, which have emerged to become popular text-to-image
generation models, can produce high-quality and content-rich images guided by
textual prompts. However, there are limitations to semantic understanding and
commonsense reasoning in existing models when the input prompts are concise
narrative, resulting in low-quality image generation. To improve the capacities
for narrative prompts, we propose a simple-yet-effective parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach called the Semantic Understanding and Reasoning adapter
(SUR-adapter) for pre-trained diffusion models. To reach this goal, we first
collect and annotate a new dataset SURD which consists of more than 57,000
semantically corrected multi-modal samples. Each sample contains a simple
narrative prompt, a complex keyword-based prompt, and a high-quality image.
Then, we align the semantic representation of narrative prompts to the complex
prompts and transfer knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to our
SUR-adapter via knowledge distillation so that it can acquire the powerful
semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities to build a high-quality
textual semantic representation for text-to-image generation. We conduct
experiments by integrating multiple LLMs and popular pre-trained diffusion
models to show the effectiveness of our approach in enabling diffusion models
to understand and reason concise natural language without image quality
degradation. Our approach can make text-to-image diffusion models easier to use
with better user experience, which demonstrates our approach has the potential
for further advancing the development of user-friendly text-to-image generation
models by bridging the semantic gap between simple narrative prompts and
complex keyword-based prompts. The code is released at

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from this paper:

**What**
This paper proposes a new method called SUR-adapter to improve the semantic understanding and reasoning (SUR) capabilities of pretrained text-to-image diffusion models when using simple narrative prompts as input. 

**Why**
Existing diffusion models rely on complex keyword prompts to generate high-quality and semantically accurate images. However, when using simple narrative prompts, these models often fail to understand the semantics and generate low-quality images. This is because the text encoder of diffusion models lacks sufficient SUR abilities for concise natural language prompts.

**How**
- The authors collect a new dataset called SURD with 57k image-text pairs, each containing a simple prompt, complex prompt and image.

- They propose the SUR-adapter module to transfer SUR knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to diffusion models via distillation. 

- The SUR-adapter aligns simple and complex prompt representations and maintains generation quality.

- Experiments on SURD show SUR-adapter enhances semantic accuracy of diffusion models for simple prompts without compromising image quality.

In summary, this paper enables diffusion models to generate high-quality and semantically accurate images from simple narrative prompts by improving their SUR capabilities using the proposed SUR-adapter and SURD dataset.

## Main Contributions

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors collected and annotated a new dataset called SURD with over 57,000 semantically corrected image-text pairs. Each pair contains a simple narrative prompt, complex keyword prompt, and high-quality image.

2. They proposed a simple yet effective fine-tuning approach called SUR-adapter to transfer semantic understanding and reasoning abilities from large language models to pretrained diffusion models.

3. The SUR-adapter aligns the semantic representation between simple and complex prompts and maintains the image generation quality of diffusion models.

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

The authors propose a fine-tuning approach called SUR-adapter to transfer semantic understanding and reasoning (SUR) abilities from large language models (LLMs) to pretrained diffusion models. 

The SUR-adapter module contains two learnable components:

1) A fully-connected network (FCN) 

2) An adapter module

The adapter module has three transformations - two for constructing query and key vectors for attention, and one for calibrating the text features.

During training, the SUR-adapter leverages the SURD dataset which contains simple prompts, complex prompts, and images. 

It employs the following techniques:

- Knowledge distillation from LLMs: The adapter distills SUR knowledge from LLMs into the query vectors through KL divergence loss. This embeds LLM abilities into the adapter.

- Performance maintenance of diffusion models: Noise is added to images from SURD and denoising loss is minimized to maintain generation quality.

- Representation alignment: KL divergence loss between simple and complex prompts is minimized to align their representations.

The overall loss function is a weighted sum of the above losses. After training, the fine-tuned diffusion model with SUR-adapter can generate images from simple prompts.

In summary, the SUR-adapter leverages knowledge distillation and representation alignment on the SURD dataset to improve SUR abilities of diffusion models while maintaining image quality.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the method proposed in this paper:

```python
# Input: 
# SURD dataset (simple prompts, complex prompts, images)
# Pretrained diffusion model 
# Pretrained LLM

# Initialize SUR-adapter module
adapter = SURAdapter() 

# Load pretrained diffusion model
diffusion_model = DiffusionModel()

# Freeze diffusion model parameters
diffusion_model.freeze_parameters()

for batch in SURD_dataloader:

  simple_prompts, complex_prompts, images = batch

  # Get LLM embeddings for simple prompts 
  llm_embeddings = LLM(simple_prompts)
  
  # Get text encoder embeddings
  text_embeddings = diffusion_model.text_encoder(simple_prompts)

  # Knowledge distillation loss
  llm_distill_loss = KL_divergence(llm_embeddings, 
                                   adapter(text_embeddings))

  # Add noise to images
  noisy_images = add_noise(images)
  
  # Denoising loss
  denoising_loss = diffusion_model(noisy_images, adapter(text_embeddings))

  # Representation alignment loss  
  align_loss = KL_divergence(diffusion_model.text_encoder(complex_prompts),
                             adapter(text_embeddings))
                             
  # Total loss
  loss = llm_distill_loss + denoising_loss + align_loss
  
  # Update SUR-adapter parameters 
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

# Finetuned diffusion model  
finetuned_model = diffusion_model + adapter

```

The key steps are using the adapter to distill LLM knowledge, maintain denoising performance, and align representations between simple and complex prompts. The trained adapter enhances the semantic abilities of the diffusion model.

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code to implement the method proposed in this paper:

```python
# SURD dataset 
surd_dataset = SURDDataset(simple_prompts, complex_prompts, images)

# DataLoader
surd_dataloader = DataLoader(surd_dataset, batch_size=16) 

# Pretrained diffusion model
diffusion_model = DiffusionModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
diffusion_model.freeze_parameters()
text_encoder = diffusion_model.text_encoder 

# Pretrained LLM
llm = LLAMA.from_pretrained(llama_model_name)

# SUR-adapter
class SURAdapter(nn.Module):

  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    
    # Learnable transformations
    self.h1 = nn.Linear(...) 
    self.h2 = nn.Linear(...)
    self.h3 = nn.Linear(...)

    self.g = nn.Linear(...)

  def forward(self, text_embeddings):

    # Attention
    q = self.h3(text_embeddings) 
    k = self.h2(text_embeddings)
    v = text_embeddings
    attn = softmax(q @ k.T / sqrt(d))
    
    # Calibrate
    calibrated = v * attn
    
    # Output 
    output = self.g(calibrated + v + self.h1(calibrated + v))
    
    return output

adapter = SURAdapter()

# Optimizer 
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(adapter.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

# Training 
for x, y, z in surd_dataloader:
  
  # x: simple prompts
  # y: complex prompts
  # z: images
  
  # Get LLM embeddings
  llm_emb = llm(x)
  
  # Get text encoder embeddings
  text_emb = text_encoder(x)

  # Forward pass
  adapter_emb = adapter(text_emb)
  
  # Losses
  llm_loss = KL_div(llm_emb, adapter.h3(text_emb))
  denoise_loss = diffusion_model(add_noise(z), adapter_emb) 
  align_loss = KL_div(text_encoder(y), adapter_emb)

  # Total loss
  loss = w1*llm_loss + w2*denoise_loss + w3*align_loss
  
  # Update
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  
# Finetuned model
finetuned_model = diffusion_model + adapter

```

The key aspects include:
- SURD dataset and dataloader
- Pretrained diffusion model and text encoder
- Pretrained LLM
- SUR-adapter module with transformations
- Loss functions and training loop
- Getting finetuned diffusion model

This shows how to implement the proposed method in a PyTorch-style code.
