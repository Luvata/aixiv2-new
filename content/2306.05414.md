Abstract: DDIM inversion has revealed the remarkable potential of real image editing
within diffusion-based methods. However, the accuracy of DDIM reconstruction
degrades as larger classifier-free guidance (CFG) scales being used for
enhanced editing. Null-text inversion (NTI) optimizes null embeddings to align
the reconstruction and inversion trajectories with larger CFG scales, enabling
real image editing with cross-attention control. Negative-prompt inversion
(NPI) further offers a training-free closed-form solution of NTI. However, it
may introduce artifacts and is still constrained by DDIM reconstruction
quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose proximal guidance and
incorporate it to NPI with cross-attention control. We enhance NPI with a
regularization term and reconstruction guidance, which reduces artifacts while
capitalizing on its training-free nature. Additionally, we extend the concepts
to incorporate mutual self-attention control, enabling geometry and layout
alterations in the editing process. Our method provides an efficient and
straightforward approach, effectively addressing real image editing tasks with
minimal computational overhead.

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

What: 
- The paper proposes a method called Proximal Negative-Prompt Inversion (ProxNPI) to improve tuning-free real image editing with diffusion models. 

Why:
- Existing methods like Null-text Inversion (NTI) and Negative-prompt Inversion (NPI) have limitations in reconstruction quality and editing capabilities when using larger classifier-free guidance scales. 

- NTI requires per-image optimization which is slow. NPI provides a fast closed-form solution but may introduce artifacts.

- ProxNPI aims to address these limitations to enable high-quality real image editing while maintaining efficiency.

How:
- ProxNPI incorporates a regularization term (proximal guidance) to constrain the noise difference between source and target, reducing artifacts.

- It also utilizes an inversion guidance technique to correct errors in the DDIM reconstruction process.

- The method is applied to both NPI+Cross-Attention control for appearance editing, and extended to Mutual Self-Attention control for geometry/layout editing.

- Ablation studies analyze the effects of different thresholds and inversion guidance strengths.

In summary, ProxNPI enhances real image editing quality and efficiency by building upon NPI using proximal regularization and inversion guidance, with applications to appearance and geometry manipulation. The proposed techniques help address key limitations of prior arts like NTI and NPI.

## Main Contributions

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

Background:
- Reviews DDIM inversion - a widely used deterministic sampling method for diffusion models.
- Explains Null-text Inversion (NTI) - optimizes null embeddings to align reconstruction and inversion trajectories under large classifier-free guidance (CFG) scales. Requires per-image optimization.  
- Introduces Negative-Prompt Inversion (NPI) - provides closed-form solution to NTI by setting null embedding to source prompt. Faster but may introduce artifacts.

Proximal Negative-Prompt Inversion:
- Proposes proximal guidance - adds regularization term to NPI to constrain noise difference between source and target. Reduces artifacts.
- Uses proximal functions like soft/hard thresholding based on quantiles.
- Incorporates inversion guidance - performs gradient descent on current latent to align with inversion latent. Corrects DDIM errors.

Proximal Mutual Self-Attention Control:
- Extends method to Mutual Self-Attention Control (MasaCtrl) for geometry/layout editing.
- Uses source prompt only in DDIM reconstruction branch, retains null in synthesis branch.
- Applies proximal guidance to constrain noise difference between null and target.

In summary, introduces proximal regularization and inversion guidance to enhance NPI, and extends it to MasaCtrl framework for geometry editing.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the key algorithms in the paper:

```python
# Proximal Negative-Prompt Inversion 

# Input
source_sample z0  
source_prompt C
target_prompt C'
diffusion_model epsilon_theta
proximal_fn prox_lambda

# Reconstruction
z_bar = DDIMInvert(z0, C, w=1)  

for t = T to 1:
  
  eps_src = epsilon_theta(z_bar, t, C)
  eps_tar = epsilon_theta(z_bar, t, C')
  
  eps = eps_src + w * prox_lambda(eps_tar - eps_src) 
  
  z_prev = DDIM step(z_bar, eps)
  
  # Inversion guidance
  if t < T_inv:
    z_prev -= eta * (z_prev - z_inv[t]) 
  
  z_bar = z_prev

return z_bar
```

```python  
# Proximal Mutual Self-Attention Control

# Reconstruction branch
eps_hat = eps_src + (eps_src - eps_src) 

# Synthesis branch 
eps_tilde = eps_null + w * prox_lambda(eps_tar - eps_null)

# Remainder of MasaCtrl algorithm...
```

The key steps are:
1) DDIM reconstruction with source prompt 
2) Apply proximal regularization to noise difference
3) Perform DDIM sampling step
4) Optional inversion guidance
5) For MasaCtrl - use source prompt only in reconstruction branch

```

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code to implement the key algorithms in the paper:

```python
# Proximal Negative-Prompt Inversion

# Inputs
z0 = source sample  
C = source prompt
C' = target prompt
epsilon_theta = diffusion model
prox_lambda = proximal function 
eta = inversion guidance step size
T_inv = timesteps for inversion guidance

# DDIM Reconstruction 
z_bar = DDIMInvert(z0, C, w=1)  

for t = T to 1:

  # Classifier-free guidance
  eps_src = epsilon_theta(z_bar, t, C) 
  eps_tar = epsilon_theta(z_bar, t, C')

  # Proximal regularization 
  eps = eps_src + w * prox_lambda(eps_tar - eps_src)

  # DDIM step
  z0_pred = DDIM_predict_x0(z_bar, eps, t) 

  # Inversion guidance
  if t < T_inv:
    mask = threshold_mask(eps_tar - eps_src)
    z0_pred -= eta * mask * (z0_pred - z0)

  z_bar = DDIM_predict_z(z0_pred, eps, t-1)

return z0_pred
```

```python
# Proximal Mutual Self-Attention Control 

# Inputs 
C, C', epsilon_theta, prox_lambda as above
alpha = interpolation ratio 

# Reconstruction
eps_hat = epsilon_theta(z_bar, t, C)

# Synthesis  
eps_null = epsilon_theta(z_bar, t, null)
eps_tar = epsilon_theta(z_bar, t, C')

eps_tilde = (1 - alpha) * eps_null + alpha * eps_hat
           + w * prox_lambda(eps_tar - eps_null) 

# Remainder of MasaCtrl algorithm...
```

```
