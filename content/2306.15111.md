# [Semi-Supervised Image Captioning with CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15111)

Authors: Chuanyang Jin

Abstract: Image captioning, a fundamental task in vision-language understanding, seeks to generate accurate natural language descriptions for provided images. The CLIP model, with its rich semantic features learned from a large corpus of image-text pairs, is well-suited for this task. In this paper, we present a two-stage semi-supervised image captioning approach that exploits the potential of CLIP encoding. Our model comprises a CLIP visual encoder, a mapping network, and a language model for text generation. In the initial stage, we train the model using a small labeled dataset by contrasting the generated captions with the ground truth captions. In the subsequent stage, we continue the training using unlabeled images, aiming to maximize the image-caption similarity based on CLIP embeddings. Remarkably, despite utilizing less than 2% of the COCO-captions, our approach delivers a performance comparable to state-of-the-art models trained on the complete dataset. Furthermore, the captions generated by our approach are more distinctive, informative, and in line with human preference.

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

What:
- The paper proposes a semi-supervised image captioning approach that utilizes CLIP embeddings and objectives. 

- The model has 3 main components: CLIP visual encoder, mapping network, GPT language model.

- A 2-stage training process is used:
    - Supervised stage: Train on small labeled dataset by comparing generated captions to reference captions.
    - Unsupervised stage: Continue training on unlabeled images by maximizing image-caption similarity based on CLIP.

Why:
- Image captioning models typically require large labeled datasets and are limited by the quality of reference captions. 

- Leveraging CLIP allows reducing reliance on labeled data and generates more descriptive, human-like captions.

How:
- CLIP encodes image into embedding, mapping network converts it to prefix input for GPT.

- Supervised stage trains with cross-entropy loss between generated and reference captions.  

- Unsupervised loss maximizes image-caption similarity based on CLIP embeddings using Gumbel-Softmax.

- Only 10,000 labeled images needed for initial supervised stage vs 1M+ typically.  

- CLIP score used for evaluation rather than just reference-based metrics.

In summary, the paper presents a semi-supervised approach for image captioning that trains initially on a small labeled dataset and then leverages CLIP embeddings and similarity for unsupervised learning to generate more informative captions while drastically reducing data dependence.

## Main Contributions

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

- Proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for image captioning that significantly reduces reliance on large labeled datasets.

- Leverages CLIP embeddings and image-text similarity objectives for unsupervised training after minimal supervised pre-training.

- Achieves strong performance using only 10,000 labeled images (less than 2% of COCO dataset) compared to 1M+ typically needed.

- Generates more descriptive, distinctive and human-like captions compared to reference similarity-based methods. 

- Introduces integrated supervised and unsupervised training within a unified framework that can be inter-switched.

- Employs Gumbel-Softmax technique to enable differentiable sampling for discrete text generation.

- Evaluates using CLIP score rather than just reference-based metrics to account for human preferences.

- Comprehensive experiments analyzing impact of supervised pre-training, comparing model variations, and evaluating against state-of-the-art methods.

- Provides implementation details to support reproducibility.

In summary, the key contributions include the semi-supervised approach, use of CLIP objectives, unified training framework, Gumbel-Softmax method, and CLIP-based evaluation, resulting in a highly data-efficient model that generates more informative and human-like captions.

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework with two stages:

Supervised Stage:
- Uses a small labeled dataset of 10,000 images (<2% of COCO) for initial training.
- Model has 3 components: CLIP encoder, mapping network, GPT decoder. 
- Mapping network converts CLIP embeddings to GPT input prefixes.
- Trains by comparing generated captions to reference captions.
- Uses cross-entropy loss between predicted and ground truth next token.

Unsupervised Stage: 
- Continues training on unlabeled images.
- Generates candidate captions for each image.
- Defines loss as negative of image-caption similarity based on CLIP.
- Seeks to maximize cosine similarity of image and text embeddings.
- Uses Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable sampling from text generation distribution.
- Refines model for ~10 epochs on unlabeled data.

The key aspects are: 1) Minimal supervised pre-training, 2) Leveraging CLIP similarity for unsupervised optimization, 3) Integrated framework switching between supervised and unsupervised.

This semi-supervised approach with CLIP objectives significantly reduces reliance on labeled data while improving caption quality.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the semi-supervised image captioning method:

```python
# Model Components
clip_encoder = CLIPEncoder() 
mapping_network = MappingNetwork()
gpt_decoder = GPTDecoder()

# Supervised Stage
labeled_data = get_small_labeled_dataset(num_images=10000) 

for epoch in num_supervised_epochs:
  
  for (image, reference_captions) in labeled_data:

    image_embedding = clip_encoder(image)
    input_prefixes = mapping_network(image_embedding) 
    generated_captions = gpt_decoder(input_prefixes)
    
    loss = caption_cross_entropy(generated_captions, reference_captions)
    update_model(loss) 

# Unsupervised Stage  
unlabeled_data = get_unlabeled_images()

for epoch in num_unsupervised_epochs:

  for image in unlabeled_data:

    image_embedding = clip_encoder(image)
    input_prefixes = mapping_network(image_embedding)
    candidate_captions = gpt_decoder.sample(input_prefixes) 
    
    caption_embeddings = clip_encoder(candidate_captions)
    image_caption_similarity = cosine_similarity(image_embedding, caption_embeddings)
    
    loss = -image_caption_similarity 
    update_model(loss)
```

The key aspects are:
1. Minimal supervised pre-training 
2. Unsupervised fine-tuning with CLIP similarity objectives
3. Integrated framework switching between supervised and unsupervised stages

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code implementation of the semi-supervised image captioning method:

```python
# Model Components
clip = CLIP() # pretrained CLIP
gpt = GPT() # pretrained GPT

mlp = MLP(in_dim=512, out_dim=10*512) # mapping network 

# Supervised Training
labeled_data = load_subset_of_coco(num_images=10000)

for epoch in range(num_supervised_epochs):
  for batch in labeled_data:
    images, reference_captions = batch
    
    # Forward Pass
    image_embeddings = clip.encode_image(images)  
    input_prefixes = mlp(image_embeddings)
    
    generated_captions = gpt.generate(input_prefixes)
    reference_embeddings = clip.encode_text(reference_captions)
    
    # Loss
    cross_entropy_loss = caption_cross_entropy(generated_captions, reference_embeddings) 
    
    # Backward Pass
    cross_entropy_loss.backward() 
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()


# Unsupervised Training 
unlabeled_data = load_rest_of_coco_images() 

for epoch in range(num_unsupervised_epochs):

  for batch in unlabeled_data:
    
    images = batch
    batch_size = images.shape[0]
    
    # Forward Pass
    image_embeddings = clip.encode_image(images)
    input_prefixes = mlp(image_embeddings)

    sampled_captions = gpt.sample(input_prefixes, 
                              num_samples=5*batch_size) 
    
    generated_caption_embeddings = clip.encode_text(sampled_captions)
    image_caption_similarities = cosine_similarity(image_embeddings, 
                                                  generated_caption_embeddings)

    # Loss 
    clip_similarities = torch.mean(image_caption_similarities, dim=1) 
    unsupervised_loss = -torch.mean(clip_similarities)
    
    # Backward Pass
    unsupervised_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```
