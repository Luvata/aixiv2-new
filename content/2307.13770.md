Abstract: As the size of transformer-based models continues to grow, fine-tuning these large-scale pretrained vision models for new tasks has become increasingly parameter-intensive. Parameter-efficient learning has been developed to reduce the number of tunable parameters during fine-tuning. Although these methods show promising results, there is still a significant performance gap compared to full fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we propose an Effective and Efficient Visual Prompt Tuning (E^2VPT) approach for large-scale transformer-based model adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a set of learnable key-value prompts and visual prompts into self-attention and input layers, respectively, to improve the effectiveness of model fine-tuning. Moreover, we design a prompt pruning procedure to systematically prune low importance prompts while preserving model performance, which largely enhances the model's efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks, with considerably low parameter usage (e.g., 0.32% of model parameters on VTAB-1k). Our code is available at https://github.com/ChengHan111/E2VPT.

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from this paper:

\textbf{What:} 
- The paper proposes E$^2$VPT, a novel framework for efficiently fine-tuning large pretrained vision transformers. It introduces learnable visual prompts and key-value prompts into the model architecture.

\textbf{Why:}
- To address limitations of prior work on parameter-efficient fine-tuning:
    - Do not consider transformer architecture design, leading to performance gap with full fine-tuning
    - Often still require tuning a large number of parameters  

\textbf{How:}
- Visual prompts are added to the input sequence of transformer layers.
- Key-value prompts are integrated into the key and value matrices in self-attention. 
- A pruning strategy removes redundant/unnecessary prompts to further improve efficiency.
- Experiments on image classification benchmarks show E$^2$VPT outperforms prior arts and achieves competitive results to full fine-tuning with far fewer parameters.

In summary, E$^2$VPT proposes an effective and efficient approach for visual prompt tuning of transformers, by designing architecture-aware prompts and pruning techniques to optimize both accuracy and parameter usage. The method demonstrates strong performance on benchmark datasets compared to prior parameter-efficient methods.

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

The paper proposes E$^2$VPT, a framework for effective and efficient visual prompt tuning of transformers. 

It has two main components:

1) Effective prompting:
- Introduces visual prompts in the input sequence of each transformer layer. These learn task-specific embeddings.

- Adds key-value prompts by concatenating small learnable matrices to the key and value matrices in self-attention. This helps capture new attention patterns. 

- Shares parameters of key-value prompts within each layer for efficiency.

2) Efficient prompting: 
- Applies a pruning technique to remove redundant input prompts:

- Token-wise pruning: Calculates importance scores for each prompt and removes those with low scores.

- Segment-wise pruning: Divides remaining prompts into segments and prunes negative segments. 

- Rewinding: Retrains the soft-filtered prompts after pruning.

In summary, the method improves effectiveness via architecture-aware visual and key-value prompts, and efficiency by pruning unnecessary prompts before retraining. The overall framework enables effective and efficient tuning of transformers for new tasks.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the E$^2$VPT method:

```python
# E^2VPT Framework

# Input: 
#   T: Pretrained transformer backbone
#   D: Dataset for new task

# Hyperparameters:
#   pv_len: Length of visual prompts
#   pkv_len: Length of key-value prompts
#   prune_rate: Percentage of prompts to prune

# Initialize visual prompts pv and key-value prompts pk, vk 
pv = init_prompts(pv_len) 
pk, vk = init_prompts(pkv_len)

# Effective Prompting
for layer in T.layers:
  layer.input = concat(pv, layer.input) 
  layer.attn = concat(layer.attn_k, pk)
  layer.attn = concat(layer.attn_v, vk) 

# Efficient Prompting  
mask = prune(pv, prune_rate) # Prune prompts
pv_pruned = pv * mask # Mask prompts

# Fine-tune 
for x, y in D:
  logits = T(pv_pruned, x) 
  loss = cross_entropy(logits, y)
  
  # Update prompts and classifier
  update(pv_pruned, pk, vk, classifier) 

# Evaluate on new task
accuracy = evaluate(T, D_test)
```

In summary, the key steps are:
1) Initialize visual and key-value prompts
2) Incorporate prompts into transformer architecture 
3) Prune redundant visual prompts
4) Fine-tune prompts and classifier on new task
5) Evaluate adapted model on test set

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code for implementing the E$^2$VPT method:

```python
# Initialize prompts
def init_prompts(length):
  return nn.Parameter(torch.randn(length, dim)) 

pv = init_prompts(pv_len)
pk, vk = init_prompts(pkv_len)

# Add prompts to transformer
class E2VPT_Transformer(nn.Module):

  def __init__(self, backbone):
    # Backbone transformer 
    self.transformer = backbone  

    # Visual prompts 
    self.pv = pv

    # Key-value prompts
    self.pk = pk 
    self.vk = vk

  def forward(self, x):
    
    for layer in self.transformer.layers:
    
      # Input 
      h = layer.input 
      h = torch.cat([self.pv, h], dim=1)

      # Self-attention
      k = layer.attn_k
      v = layer.attn_v
      
      k = torch.cat([k, self.pk], dim=2) 
      v = torch.cat([v, self.vk], dim=2)

      h = layer(h, k, v) # self-attention + mlp

    return h # output

# Pruning
def prune(prompt, rate):
  
  score = torch.autograd.grad(loss, prompt)[0]

  threshold = np.percentile(score, rate*100)
  mask = score > threshold 
  
  return mask

# Fine-tuning loop
for x, y in loader:

  # Forward
  logits = model(x)  

  # Calculate loss
  loss = criterion(logits, y)

  # Prune
  mask = prune(model.pv, prune_rate)

  # Update 
  optim.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  
  with torch.no_grad():
   model.pv.grad *= mask # Masked gradients
  
  optim.step() # Update
```

The key aspects are:
- Initializing visual and key-value prompts
- Incorporating prompts into transformer layers
- Pruning prompts by thresholding gradients
- Updating prompts with masked gradients

This implements the overall E$^2$VPT framework for efficient transformer fine-tuning.
