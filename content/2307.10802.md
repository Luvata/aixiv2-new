# [Meta-Transformer: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10802)

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities ($\textit{e.g.}$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a $\textbf{frozen}$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers. Code will be available at https://github.com/invictus717/MetaTransformer

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

What:
- The paper proposes a framework called Meta-Transformer for unified multimodal learning. It can process and relate information from multiple modalities like text, images, audio, point clouds, etc using the same model architecture and parameters.

Why:  
- Existing multimodal models are limited in their ability to handle diverse modalities due to gaps between them. They focus mainly on vision and language tasks.
- A unified model architecture that works across modalities can help reduce the modality gap and avoid the need for paired training data.

How:
- The Meta-Transformer has 3 components - a modality-specialist tokenizer, a shared encoder, and task-specific heads.

- The tokenizer converts raw inputs into token sequences in a shared embedding space. 

- The encoder with frozen pretrained parameters extracts high-level features from the token sequences.

- Lightweight task-specific heads are then trained for downstream tasks.

- This allows task-specific representations to be learned from a unified architecture without paired multimodal data.

- The model is pretrained on image data and evaluated on 12 modalities - text, image, point clouds, audio, video, infrared, hyperspectral, X-ray, IMU, tabular, graph, time-series.

- It shows strong performance on various tasks like classification, detection, segmentation across modalities, validating its capability for unified multimodal learning.

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

The Meta-Transformer has 3 main components:

1. Data-to-Sequence Tokenization
- Proposes a meta tokenization scheme to transform raw data from different modalities into token sequences in a shared embedding space.

- For text, uses WordPiece tokenization with 30K vocabulary and maps to token embeddings. 

- For images, reshapes into flattened 2D patches, then projects patches to token embeddings.

- For point clouds, uses FPS and KNN to sample representative points and group neighbors. Aggregates features from neighbor groups. 

- For audio, uses log Mel filterbanks and convolutions to get spectrogram slices. Flattens and projects to get token embeddings.

2. Unified Encoder
- Uses a ViT encoder pretrained on LAION-2B image dataset with contrastive learning. Fixes pretrained parameters.

- Augments token embeddings with 1D positional encodings before feeding to encoder.

- Encoder has multiple Transformer blocks with MSA and MLP layers. Uses standard architecture.

- Extracts semantic features from token sequences of different modalities using frozen encoder.

3. Task-Specific Heads
- Lightweight MLP heads adapted for downstream tasks through training.

- Varies based on modalities and tasks like classification, regression, etc.

- Updated with tokenizer to learn task-specific representations.

So in summary, it uses modality-specific tokenizers, a shared pretrained encoder, and adaptable task heads to enable unified multimodal learning from different data types.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the Meta-Transformer:

```python
# Modality-specific tokenizers 
text_tokens = text_tokenizer(text_data)
image_tokens = image_tokenizer(image_data) 
pointcloud_tokens = pointcloud_tokenizer(pointcloud_data)
audio_tokens = audio_tokenizer(audio_data)

# Shared encoder with frozen params
encoder = PretrainedTransformerEncoder() 
encoder.params.requires_grad = False

text_embeddings = encoder(text_tokens) 
image_embeddings = encoder(image_tokens)
pointcloud_embeddings = encoder(pointcloud_tokens) 
audio_embeddings = encoder(audio_tokens)

# Task-specific heads
text_head = MLPHead(text_embeddings)
image_head = MLPHead(image_embeddings) 
pointcloud_head = MLPHead(pointcloud_embeddings)
audio_head = MLPHead(audio_embeddings)

# Optimization
loss = text_head.loss(...) + image_head.loss(...) + ... 
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward() 
optimizer.step() # update tokenizer and task heads
```

In summary, it tokenizes different modalities separately, encodes them using a shared frozen encoder, and adds lightweight adaptable heads for downstream tasks. The tokenizer and task heads are updated during training while the encoder parameters remain fixed.

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code to implement the Meta-Transformer framework:

```python
# Modality-specific tokenizers
def text_tokenizer(text):
  tokens = wordpiece_tokenize(text) 
  embeddings = word_embedding(tokens)
  return embeddings

def image_tokenizer(image):
  patches = reshape_to_patches(image)
  embeddings = linear_project(patches) 
  return embeddings
  
def pointcloud_tokenizer(pointcloud):
  points = fps(pointcloud)
  groups = knn(points)
  features = aggregate_features(groups)
  embeddings = linear_project(features)
  return embeddings
  
def audio_tokenizer(audio):
  spectrogram = log_mel_fb(audio) 
  patches = conv_2d(spectrogram)
  embeddings = flatten(patches)
  return embeddings
  

# Shared encoder
class Encoder(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.transformer = Transformer(...)
    
  def forward(self, x):
    x = self.transformer(x) 
    return x
  
encoder = Encoder()
encoder.load_pretrained(...) # initialize 
encoder.requires_grad = False # freeze parameters

# Task heads
class MLPHead(nn.Module):
  ...
  
text_head = MLPHead(...) 
image_head = MLPHead(...)
...

# Training 
for x_text, y_text in text_dataloader:
  for x_image, y_image in image_dataloader:
    
    text_tokens = text_tokenizer(x_text)
    image_tokens = image_tokenizer(x_image)
    
    text_embeddings = encoder(text_tokens) 
    image_embeddings = encoder(image_tokens)
    
    text_out = text_head(text_embeddings)
    image_out = image_head(image_embeddings)
    
    loss_text = loss_fn(text_out, y_text)
    loss_image = loss_fn(image_out, y_image)
    
    loss = loss_text + loss_image
    ...
    
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step() # update tokenizers and heads
```

So in summary, it has separate tokenizers for each modality, a shared pretrained frozen encoder, lightweight adaptable heads, and an optimization loop that updates the tokenizers and heads while keeping the encoder fixed.
