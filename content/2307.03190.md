Abstract: We introduce Text2Cinemagraph, a fully automated method for creating cinemagraphs from text descriptions - an especially challenging task when prompts feature imaginary elements and artistic styles, given the complexity of interpreting the semantics and motions of these images. Existing single-image animation methods fall short on artistic inputs, and recent text-based video methods frequently introduce temporal inconsistencies, struggling to keep certain regions static. To address these challenges, we propose an idea of synthesizing image twins from a single text prompt - a pair of an artistic image and its pixel-aligned corresponding natural-looking twin. While the artistic image depicts the style and appearance detailed in our text prompt, the realistic counterpart greatly simplifies layout and motion analysis. Leveraging existing natural image and video datasets, we can accurately segment the realistic image and predict plausible motion given the semantic information. The predicted motion can then be transferred to the artistic image to create the final cinemagraph. Our method outperforms existing approaches in creating cinemagraphs for natural landscapes as well as artistic and other-worldly scenes, as validated by automated metrics and user studies. Finally, we demonstrate two extensions: animating existing paintings and controlling motion directions using text.

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from this paper:

What:
- The paper introduces Text2Cinemagraph, a new method to automatically create cinemagraphs from text descriptions. Cinemagraphs are images with certain moving elements while the rest of the image stays still. 

Why:
- Existing methods for generating cinemagraphs from a single image struggle with artistic/imaginative inputs. Text-to-video methods often have temporal inconsistencies.
- Text2Cinemagraph aims to overcome these limitations and allow users to create cinemagraphs for real and imaginary scenes using just text prompts.

How:
- The method generates twin images from the text prompt - an artistic image depicting the style/content, and a natural image with the same layout.
- The natural image is used to predict optical flow and mask using existing models. This flow is transferred to the artistic image.
- The artistic image with the predicted flow/mask is animated into a cinemagraph using symmetric warping.

Key Findings:
- Text2Cinemagraph outperforms baselines on creating cinemagraphs from real and artistic images based on automated metrics and user studies.
- Ablations validate the need for twin images, masks, and text conditioning.
- The method also enables control of motion directions using text and animating existing paintings.

In summary, Text2Cinemagraph enables fully automated generation of visually appealing and temporally coherent cinemagraphs from text for both real and imaginary scenes. The twin image idea helps bridge the gap between artistic images and existing flow/video models.

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

The goal is to generate a cinemagraph from a user-provided artistic text prompt that describes the scene content and style. 

The key idea is to synthesize twin images from the text prompt:

1) Artistic image (A): Captures the artistic style described in the text prompt. This will be the final cinemagraph output.

2) Natural image (N): A corresponding natural looking image with the same semantic layout as A. 

The natural image N allows leveraging existing models trained on real images to predict plausible motion and masks.

Twin Image Generation:
- Generate artistic image A from text prompt using Stable Diffusion. 
- Automatically create a natural prompt by extracting nouns and adding "natural" terms.
- Generate natural image N using the same diffusion model, while injecting A's internal features to enforce layout similarity.

Mask Prediction: 
- Get semantic segmentation on N using ODISE model. 
- Refine the mask using self-attention maps from image generation.

Flow Prediction:
- Predict optical flow on N conditioned on text prompt and mask using flow prediction network.

Cinemagraph Generation:
- Transfer the predicted flow from N to A.
- Animate A into a cinemagraph using the flow, mask, and a video generation network.

In summary, twin images are used to obtain optical flow and masks for the artistic image by leveraging models designed for real images. This optical flow then animates the artistic image into the final cinemagraph output.

# Generate twin images
art_img = generate_artistic_image(text_prompt) 
nat_prompt = get_natural_prompt(text_prompt)
nat_img = generate_natural_image(nat_prompt, art_img) 

# Get mask
nat_mask = segment_image(nat_img, region_name)  
art_mask = refine_mask(nat_mask, art_img)

# Predict flow 
nat_flow = predict_optical_flow(nat_img, text_prompt, art_mask)
art_flow = nat_flow 

# Generate cinemagraph
cinemagraph = animate_image(art_img, art_flow, art_mask)
```

# Generate twin images

  # use Stable Diffusion and inject art_img features

# Get mask   
def segment_image(nat_img, region_name):
  # use pre-trained model like ODISE

# Generate cinemagraph
