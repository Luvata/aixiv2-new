# [AltDiffusion: A Multilingual Text-to-Image Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09991)

Authors: Fulong Ye, Guang Liu, Xinya Wu, Ledell Wu

Abstract: Large Text-to-Image(T2I) diffusion models have shown a remarkable capability
to produce photorealistic and diverse images based on text inputs. However,
existing works only support limited language input, e.g., English, Chinese, and
Japanese, leaving users beyond these languages underserved and blocking the
global expansion of T2I models. Therefore, this paper presents AltDiffusion, a
novel multilingual T2I diffusion model that supports eighteen different
languages. Specifically, we first train a multilingual text encoder based on
the knowledge distillation. Then we plug it into a pretrained English-only
diffusion model and train the model with a two-stage schema to enhance the
multilingual capability, including concept alignment and quality improvement
stage on a large-scale multilingual dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark, which includes Multilingual-General-18(MG-18) and
Multilingual-Cultural-18(MC-18) datasets, to evaluate the capabilities of T2I
diffusion models for generating high-quality images and capturing
culture-specific concepts in different languages. Experimental results on both
MG-18 and MC-18 demonstrate that AltDiffusion outperforms current
state-of-the-art T2I models, e.g., Stable Diffusion in multilingual
understanding, especially with respect to culture-specific concepts, while
still having comparable capability for generating high-quality images. All

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from this paper: 

What:
- The paper introduces AltDiffusion, a novel multilingual text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model that supports 18 languages. 

- The authors also introduce a new benchmark with two datasets for evaluating multilingual T2I models:
    - Multilingual-General-18 (MG-18): For evaluating general image generation quality.
    - Multilingual-Cultural-18 (MC-18): For evaluating culture-specific concept generation.

Why:  
- Existing T2I models like Stable Diffusion only support limited languages like English, restricting their applicability. 

- Multilingual models allow direct use of languages without translation, avoiding errors and loss of cultural nuances.

- Evaluating culture-specific concept generation is important for multilingual models but lacked benchmark datasets.

How:
- They first train a multilingual text encoder using knowledge distillation.

- The text encoder is plugged into a pretrained English-only diffusion model. 

- The diffusion model is trained using a two-stage approach on multilingual datasets to enhance its language capability.

- Experiments show AltDiffusion outperforms other multilingual models in image quality and understanding cultural concepts.

In summary, this paper introduces a new multilingual diffusion model AltDiffusion that supports 18 languages, and benchmarks to evaluate multilingual image generation quality and cultural concept understanding. The two-stage training approach enhances the model's multilingual capabilities. Experiments show improved performance over existing multilingual models.

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

The goal is to develop a multilingual text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model that can support diverse languages. 

The method has two main steps:

1. Enhancing the language capability of the text encoder:
- They first train a multilingual text encoder using knowledge distillation from a teacher model (OpenCLIP). 
- The student model is XLM-R, trained to match embeddings from the teacher on parallel English-other language text pairs.
- This results in a text encoder supporting 18 languages with aligned embedding space.

2. Enhancing the language capability of the UNet:
- The pretrained multilingual text encoder is plugged into an off-the-shelf English-only diffusion model (Stable Diffusion).
- A two-stage training approach is used to adapt the diffusion model:
  - Concept alignment stage: Only the cross-attention module is trained on a large multilingual dataset to align text-image embeddings.
  - Quality improvement stage: All UNet parameters are fine-tuned on a high-quality aesthetic dataset to improve image quality.
- Classifier-free guidance is also used to improve training.

In summary, the method involves:
1) Knowledge distillation to obtain a multilingual text encoder 
2) Plugging it into an English diffusion model
3) Two-stage training of the diffusion model for concept alignment and quality improvement.

This results in a full multilingual T2I diffusion model AltDiffusion that can support diverse languages directly without needing translation.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the method presented in this paper:

```python
# Train multilingual text encoder
text_encoder = XLMRobertaForTextEncoder() 
teacher = OpenCLIPTextEncoder()

for en_text, other_text in parallel_text_pairs:
  teacher_embeddings = teacher(en_text)  
  student_embeddings = text_encoder(other_text)
  
  loss = MSE(teacher_embeddings, student_embeddings)
  optimize(loss) 

# Enhance diffusion model  
diffusion_model = StableDiffusion()
diffusion_model.text_encoder = text_encoder 

# Concept alignment
freeze(diffusion_model)  
unfreeze(diffusion_model.cross_attention)

for x, t in multilingual_dataset:
  noisy_x = add_noise(x)
  t_emb = text_encoder(t)
  
  pred = diffusion_model(noisy_x, t_emb)
  loss = MSE(x, pred) 
  optimize(loss)

# Quality improvement  
unfreeze(diffusion_model)

for x, t in aesthetic_dataset:
  noisy_x = add_noise(x)
  t_emb = text_encoder(t) 
  
  pred = diffusion_model(noisy_x, t_emb)
  loss = MSE(x, pred)
  optimize(loss)

# Classifier free guidance
for x, t in aesthetic_dataset:
  noisy_x = add_noise(x)
  
  pred_uncond = diffusion_model(noisy_x) 
  pred_cond = diffusion_model(noisy_x, t_emb)
  
  pred = pred_uncond + alpha * (pred_cond - pred_uncond)
  loss = MSE(x, pred)
  optimize(loss) 
```

This shows the high-level steps of:
1) Training the multilingual text encoder 
2) Plugging it into the diffusion model
3) Concept alignment stage
4) Quality improvement stage 
5) Adding classifier free guidance

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code to implement the method presented in this paper:

```python
# Multilingual Text Encoder

text_encoder = XLMRobertaForTextEncoder() # Initialize student model
teacher = OpenCLIPTextEncoder() # Initialize teacher model

optim = AdamW(text_encoder.parameters())

for en_text, other_text in parallel_text_pairs:
  
  teacher_embeddings = teacher(en_text)
  student_embeddings = text_encoder(other_text) 
  
  loss = MSELoss(teacher_embeddings, student_embeddings)
  
  optim.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optim.step()

# Enhance Diffusion Model

diffusion_model = StableDiffusion() 

diffusion_model.text_encoder = text_encoder # Plug in text encoder

optim = AdamW(diffusion_model.parameters())

# Concept Alignment

for param in diffusion_model.parameters():
  param.requires_grad = False 
  
for param in diffusion_model.cross_attention.parameters():
  param.requires_grad = True
  
for x, t in multilingual_dataset:

  noisy_x = GaussianNoise(x)  
  t_emb = text_encoder(t)
   
  pred = diffusion_model(noisy_x, t_emb) 
  loss = MSELoss(x, pred)  
  
  optim.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optim.step()


# Quality Improvement

for param in diffusion_model.parameters():
  param.requires_grad = True 

for x, t in aesthetic_dataset:

  noisy_x = GaussianNoise(x)
  t_emb = text_encoder(t)

  pred = diffusion_model(noisy_x, t_emb)
  loss = MSELoss(x, pred)

  optim.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()  
  optim.step()


# Classifier Free Guidance

for x, t in aesthetic_dataset:
  
  noisy_x = GaussianNoise(x)

  pred_uncond = diffusion_model(noisy_x)
  pred_cond = diffusion_model(noisy_x, t_emb) 
  
  pred = pred_uncond + alpha * (pred_cond - pred_uncond)
  loss = MSELoss(x, pred)

  optim.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optim.step()
```

This shows a more detailed pseudo code implementation with:
- Initializing models
- Training loops
- Getting embeddings
- Applying noise
- Gradient calculation
- Optimization

Covering the key steps of training the text encoder, concept alignment stage, quality improvement stage, and classifier free guidance of the diffusion model.
