Abstract: Recent data-driven image colorization methods have enabled automatic or reference-based colorization, while still suffering from unsatisfactory and inaccurate object-level color control. To address these issues, we propose a new method called DiffColor that leverages the power of pre-trained diffusion models to recover vivid colors conditioned on a prompt text, without any additional inputs. DiffColor mainly contains two stages: colorization with generative color prior and in-context controllable colorization. Specifically, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-image model to generate colorized images using a CLIP-based contrastive loss. Then we try to obtain an optimized text embedding aligning the colorized image and the text prompt, and a fine-tuned diffusion model enabling high-quality image reconstruction. Our method can produce vivid and diverse colors with a few iterations, and keep the structure and background intact while having colors well-aligned with the target language guidance. Moreover, our method allows for in-context colorization, i.e., producing different colorization results by modifying prompt texts without any fine-tuning, and can achieve object-level controllable colorization results. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that DiffColor outperforms previous works in terms of visual quality, color fidelity, and diversity of colorization options.

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from this paper:

What:
- The paper presents a new method called DiffColor for high-fidelity text-guided image colorization using diffusion models. 

- DiffColor aims to recover vivid and diverse colors conditioned on a text prompt without requiring additional inputs.

Why:  
- Existing colorization methods struggle with unsatisfactory and inaccurate object-level color control. 

- Diffusion models have shown impressive results for image generation but lack ability to edit parts of images while preserving other areas.

- Text descriptions allow incorporating prior knowledge to guide the colorization process.

How:
- DiffColor has two main stages:
   1) Colorization with generative color prior: Fine-tune a diffusion model using a contrastive loss to generate colorized images guided by text.
   2) In-context controllable colorization: Optimize text embedding to align with colorized image and fine-tune diffusion model. Allows modifying text prompts to edit colors without retraining.

- Evaluate both quantitatively (metrics like FID, LPIPS, CLIP score) and qualitatively (user studies).

- Outperforms previous methods in quality, fidelity, diversity of colorization options.

In summary, this paper presents a novel text-guided image colorization approach using diffusion models called DiffColor. It aims to leverage text prompts to recover vivid, diverse colors with accurate object-level control. The method fine-tunes diffusion models with a contrastive loss and optimizes text embeddings. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing colorization techniques.

## Main Contributions

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

- Development of a new framework (DiffColor) that utilizes text-guided diffusion models for high-fidelity and controllable image colorization.

- Incorporation of a novel color contrastive loss as guidance during training to align the generated images with the text descriptions. 

- A two-stage color refinement process with spatial alignment to improve image structure preservation and text embedding optimization for controllability.

- Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art colorization methods in terms of quality, diversity, and text alignment.

- Qualitative results showing the ability to perform diverse in-context colorization edits by simply modifying the text prompts.

- Quantitative evaluations using metrics like FID, LPIPS, CLIP score, PSNR, and SSIM to measure quality and text-image relevance.

- User studies that show preference for DiffColor over other methods in terms of color vividness, colorfulness and text consistency.

In summary, the key contributions are:

1) A new text-guided diffusion framework for colorization
2) A novel contrastive loss for training guidance 
3) A two-stage refinement process
4) Comprehensive experiments and evaluations demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
5) Qualitative and quantitative results proving controllable diverse colorization
6) User studies confirming superior color quality and text alignment

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

The proposed DiffColor framework contains two main stages:

1. Colorization with Generative Color Prior
- Input grayscale image encoded to latent code z 
- Denoising model takes z and text embedding of context prompt c
- Fine-tune model using contrastive loss and diffusion guidance loss 
- Contrastive loss brings accurate colors using c and anti-color texts c-
- Output primary colorized image xrgb_pri
- Use spatial alignment module to align xrgb_pri and grayscale image, obtaining aligned color image x^rgb_pri

2. In-context Controllable Colorization 
- Input is x^rgb_pri and target text prompt ĉ with color descriptions
- Rewrite context prompt c with unique identifiers as c' 
- Optimize embedding of c' to maximize similarity with x^rgb_pri
- Fine-tune diffusion model to reconstruct colorized image x^rgb_rec
- Get target embedding e_tgt from ĉ
- Interpolate between optimized and target embeddings 
- Generate final colorized image x^rgb_fin conditioned on interpolated embedding
- Align with grayscale image to get output image x^rgb_fin

In summary, the method consists of two stages. The first uses a contrastive loss to fine-tune a diffusion model for initial colorization. The second optimizes text embeddings and fine-tunes the model again to enable controllable color editing by modifying the text prompts. Spatial alignment helps preserve structure.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the DiffColor method:

```python
# Stage 1: Colorization with generative color prior

gray_img = input grayscale image 
context_prompt = input text describing gray_img content

# Encode gray_img to latent code
latent_code = encoder(gray_img)  

# Get context embedding from CLIP text encoder 
context_emb = CLIP_text_encoder(context_prompt)

# Fine-tune diffusion model using contrastive loss
for i in iterations:
  noisy_latent = add_noise(latent_code) 
  rgb_img = diffusion_model(noisy_latent, context_emb)  
  loss = contrastive_loss(rgb_img, context_prompt, anti_color_prompts)
  update_diffusion_model(loss)

# Spatial alignment  
aligned_rgb_img = spatial_align(rgb_img, gray_img)

# Stage 2: In-context controllable colorization

target_prompt = add color descriptions to context_prompt 

# Rewrite context prompt with identifiers
rewritten_prompt = add_identifiers(context_prompt)  

# Optimize context embedding
optimized_emb = optimize_embedding(rewritten_prompt, aligned_rgb_img)

# Fine-tune diffusion model
fine_tuned_model = finetune(diffusion_model, optimized_emb, aligned_rgb_img)

# Get target embedding
target_emb = CLIP_text_encoder(target_prompt)

# Interpolate embeddings
interp_emb = interpolate(optimized_emb, target_emb)

# Generate final colorized image
final_rgb_img = fine_tuned_model(latent_code, interp_emb) 

# Spatial alignment
output_img = spatial_align(final_rgb_img, gray_img)
```

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code implementation of the DiffColor method:

```python
# Load pre-trained models
encoder = load_encoder()
diffusion_model = load_diffusion_model() 
CLIP = load_CLIP()
align_model = load_align_model()

# Stage 1: Colorization with generative color prior

# Input
gray_img = load_grayscale_image()
context_prompt = "A photo of a cat" 

# Encode image
latent_code = encoder(gray_img)  

# Get context embedding
context_emb = CLIP.encode_text(context_prompt) 

# Define anti-color prompts
anti_prompts = ["A grayscale image", "A scratchy photo"]

# Fine-tune diffusion model
for i in range(1500):
  
  # Add noise
  noisy_latent = add_noise(latent_code)
  
  # Generate image
  rgb_img = diffusion_model(noisy_latent, context_emb) 
  
  # Get image embedding
  img_emb = CLIP.encode_image(rgb_img)

  # Calculate contrastive loss
  pos_sim = cosine_sim(img_emb, context_emb)
  neg_sims = [cosine_sim(img_emb, CLIP.encode_text(anti)) for anti in anti_prompts]
  loss = contrastive_loss(pos_sim, neg_sims)
  
  # Update model
  update_diffusion_model(loss) 

# Spatial alignment
aligned_rgb_img = align_model(rgb_img, gray_img) 

# Stage 2: In-context controllable colorization

# Input
target_prompt = "A brown cat"

# Rewrite context prompt  
rewritten_prompt = rewrite_with_ids(context_prompt)

# Optimize context embedding
optimized_emb = optimize_embedding(rewritten_prompt, aligned_rgb_img, steps=500) 

# Fine-tune model
fine_tuned_model = finetune(diffusion_model, optimized_emb, aligned_rgb_img, steps=1000)

# Get target embedding
target_emb = CLIP.encode_text(target_prompt) 

# Interpolate embeddings
interp_emb = interpolate(optimized_emb, target_emb)

# Generate final image
final_rgb_img = fine_tuned_model(latent_code, interp_emb)

# Align
output_img = align_model(final_rgb_img, gray_img)
```
