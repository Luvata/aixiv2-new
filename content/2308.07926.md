Abstract: We present the content deformation field CoDeF as a new type of video
representation, which consists of a canonical content field aggregating the
static contents in the entire video and a temporal deformation field recording
the transformations from the canonical image (i.e., rendered from the canonical
content field) to each individual frame along the time axis.Given a target
video, these two fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct it through a
carefully tailored rendering pipeline.We advisedly introduce some
regularizations into the optimization process, urging the canonical content
field to inherit semantics (e.g., the object shape) from the video.With such a
design, CoDeF naturally supports lifting image algorithms for video processing,
in the sense that one can apply an image algorithm to the canonical image and
effortlessly propagate the outcomes to the entire video with the aid of the
temporal deformation field.We experimentally show that CoDeF is able to lift
image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and lift keypoint
detection to keypoint tracking without any training.More importantly, thanks to
our lifting strategy that deploys the algorithms on only one image, we achieve
superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos compared to existing
video-to-video translation approaches, and even manage to track non-rigid
objects like water and smog.Project page can be found at

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

What:
- The paper proposes representing a video using a "content deformation field" (CoDeF). This consists of a canonical content field that captures the static contents, and a temporal deformation field that captures how each frame deforms from the canonical content. 

- The canonical content field is a 2D image that aggregates all the visual content from across the video frames. The temporal deformation field is a 3D field that stores the deformation to transform points from the canonical image to each frame.

- Both fields are represented using hash-based neural implicit representations for efficiency and capacity.

Why:
- Representing videos this way allows lifting image algorithms directly to video tasks with high temporal consistency. For example, image-to-image translation or segmentation on the canonical image can be propagated to all frames through the deformation field.

- Previous video representations like video mosaics or neural layered atlases have limitations in faithfully capturing details and semantics. The proposed CoDeF aims to achieve better reconstruction quality and canonical image naturalness.

How:
- The canonical and deformation fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct the input frames through a differentiable rendering pipeline. 

- Regularization losses are used to encourage semantic correctness of the canonical image. Techniques like annealed hash encoding and optical flow consistency help with deformation smoothness.

- For video tasks, established image algorithms are simply applied on the canonical image, and results propagated to all frames via the deformation field. This lifts image tasks to video with temporal consistency.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel video representation using content and deformation fields to enable lifting image algorithms to video tasks with high consistency. The key ideas are joint optimization, regularization for semantics, and leveraging the deformation field for propagation.

## Method Section

Here is a summary of the method section from the paper:

The paper proposes representing a video using two components - a canonical content field and a temporal deformation field. 

The canonical content field is a 2D image that aggregates all static textures from the video frames. It is implemented as a 2D hash table using a multilayer perceptron (MLP).

The deformation field captures the per-frame motion from the canonical space. It is a 3D hash table implemented using 3D encodings and an MLP.

To obtain high capacity and efficiency, both fields use multi-resolution hash encoding techniques based on an encoded grid.

During training, the fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct the input frames through differentiable rendering. Regularization losses are added to encourage semantic correctness and smooth deformations.

Specifically, annealed hash encoding is used to progressively add high-frequency details. Optical flow consistency loss improves smoothness. For complex motions, grouped deformation fields based on segmentation masks are proposed.

After optimization, the canonical image can directly leverage image algorithms like translation, segmentation or super-resolution. Their outputs are propagated to all frames using the deformation field, thereby lifting image tasks to video.

In summary, the key ideas are the joint content and deformation field representation, the use of hash encodings and MLPs, and regularization techniques to enable lifting image algorithms to video with temporal consistency.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the method proposed in the paper:

```python
# Represent video V as canonical image Ic and deformation field D

# Canonical content field C as 2D hash table 
C = HashMLP(x) 

# Temporal deformation field D as 3D hash table
D = HashMLP(x, t)

# Jointly optimize C and D to reconstruct V
for iter in iterations:
  
  # Sample points x from frames
  
  # Get color prediction 
  c = C(D(x, t))
  
  # Loss between c and frame color
  
  # Update C and D networks

# Extract canonical image Ic from optimized C 

# Apply image algorithm X on Ic to get output O

O = X(Ic)

# Propagate O to all frames using D
for t in frames:

  xt = D(x, t) # Deform

  Ot = O(xt) # Propagate output

# Render propagated O with frame t
```

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Represent video as C and D fields using hash MLPs
2. Optimize C and D for video reconstruction
3. Apply algorithm on canonical Ic from C
4. Propagate output to frames using D

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code implementation of the method proposed in the paper:

```python
# Video V with frames I1, I2, .. IN

# Canonical content field C as 2D hash table
# L levels, F feature dims per level 
C = HashMLP2D(x, L, F) 

# Temporal deformation field D as 3D hash table 
# T entries in hash table
D = HashMLP3D(x, t, T) 

# Initialize C, D networks

# Hyperparams
iterations = 10000
位1, 位2 = 1, 10 

for iter in range(iterations):

  # Sample points x in frame Ii
  
  # Get color prediction
  x' = D(Hash3D(x, i), i) 
  c = C(x')

  # Reconstruction loss
  Lrec = ||c - Ii(x)||2  

  # Sample flowed points x' in Ii+1
  x' = x + Flow(x, i->i+1)

  # Flow consistency loss
  Lflow = ||D(Hash3D(x, i)) - D(Hash3D(x', i+1)) - (x' - x)||

  # Total loss
  L = Lrec + 位1*Lflow + 位2*Lbg

  # Update C, D networks

# Render canonical image Ic from C

# Apply algorithm X on Ic to get output O
O = X(Ic)  

# Propagate O to frames
for i in frames:
  
  # Get deformed coordinates 
  x' = D(Hash3D(x, i), i)  

  # Sample output
  Oi(x) = O(x')

# Render Oi with frame Ii
```

The key additions compared to the high-level version:

- Detailed hash encoding and MLP architectures
