Abstract: Recent text-guided diffusion models provide powerful image generation
capabilities. Currently, a massive effort is given to enable the modification
of these images using text only as means to offer intuitive and versatile
editing. To edit a real image using these state-of-the-art tools, one must
first invert the image with a meaningful text prompt into the pretrained
model's domain. In this paper, we introduce an accurate inversion technique and
thus facilitate an intuitive text-based modification of the image. Our proposed
inversion consists of two novel key components: (i) Pivotal inversion for
diffusion models. While current methods aim at mapping random noise samples to
a single input image, we use a single pivotal noise vector for each timestamp
and optimize around it. We demonstrate that a direct inversion is inadequate on
its own, but does provide a good anchor for our optimization. (ii) NULL-text
optimization, where we only modify the unconditional textual embedding that is
used for classifier-free guidance, rather than the input text embedding. This
allows for keeping both the model weights and the conditional embedding intact
and hence enables applying prompt-based editing while avoiding the cumbersome
tuning of the model's weights. Our Null-text inversion, based on the publicly
available Stable Diffusion model, is extensively evaluated on a variety of
images and prompt editing, showing high-fidelity editing of real images.

## What, Why and How

 Here is a summary of the key points from this paper:

What:

- This paper proposes a new method for inverting real images into the latent space of text-guided diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. This allows editing the images using only text prompts.

- The method has two main components:
   - Pivotal inversion: Uses the trajectory from an initial DDIM inversion as a fixed pivot point to efficiently optimize a single noise vector per image. 
   - Null-text optimization: Optimizes only the unconditional "null" text embedding while keeping the model weights fixed. This allows accurate reconstruction while preserving editability.

Why: 

- Existing inversion methods for diffusion models struggle to accurately reconstruct real images while still allowing intuitive text-based editing capabilities.

- Directly optimizing the text embedding can damage model priors. Fine-tuning the model weights requires duplicating the model per image.

- Pivotal inversion is more efficient than optimizing multiple random noise vectors. Null-text optimization preserves editability better than tuning the conditional text embedding.

How:

- Perform initial DDIM inversion to get a trajectory of latent codes (pivot).

- Optimize unconditional null-text embedding around pivot to accurately reconstruct image.

- Use optimized null text-embedding at inference time to allow text-based editing of inverted image via prompt manipulation.

In summary, the paper introduces pivotal inversion and null-text optimization to enable high-fidelity reconstruction of real images in diffusion models, while retaining the ability to intuitively edit them using only text prompts. This bridges the gap between reconstruction and editability.

## Main Contributions

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

- Proposes a novel inversion technique for real images in text-guided diffusion models that enables high-fidelity reconstruction and retention of text-based editing capabilities.

- Introduces the concept of pivotal inversion for diffusion models - uses a fixed trajectory from initial DDIM inversion as a pivot for efficient optimization.

- Introduces null-text optimization - optimizes the unconditional null text embedding while keeping model weights and conditional text embedding fixed.

- Shows that direct DDIM inversion fails for text-guided diffusion models with classifier-free guidance due to error amplification.

- Demonstrates that null-text optimization with pivotal inversion outperforms standard textual inversion techniques.

- Validates that null-text optimization depends on pivotal inversion and fails without it.

- Shows high-fidelity inversion and editing results on real images using the publicly available Stable Diffusion model.

1) Pivotal inversion for diffusion models
2) Null-text optimization technique
3) An effective inversion approach enabling text-based editing of real images.

## Method Section

 Here is a summary of the method section:

The goal is to invert a real image I and prompt P into the latent space of a pretrained text-guided diffusion model to enable text-based editing.

The proposed method has two key components:

1. Pivotal Inversion

- Perform initial DDIM inversion with guidance scale w=1 to get a trajectory of latent codes z* (the pivot).

- DDIM inversion alone fails with standard guidance scale due to error amplification.

- Use z* trajectory as a fixed pivot for optimization instead of random noise vectors.

- For each timestep t, optimize to minimize ||z*_t-1 - z_t-1|| where z_t-1 is the optimized latent code.

- Optimization is efficient as it focuses on a single pivotal trajectory.

2. Null-Text Optimization 

- Instead of tuning model weights or text embedding, optimize the unconditional "null" text embedding.

- Initialize null embedding with original one from pretrained model.

- Can use a different null embedding varnothing_t per timestep.

- Keeps model weights and conditional text embedding fixed.

- Preserves text-editing capabilities better than tuning text embedding.

The full algorithm:

- Get z* pivot trajectory using DDIM inversion (w=1). 

- Initialize varnothing_T with original null embedding.

- For t=T to 1:
   - Optimize varnothing_t to minimize ||z*_t-1 - z_t-1|| 
   - Update varnothing_t-1 = varnothing_t
   - Update latent code z_t-1 for next step

- Return z_T and {varnothing_t} for editing by modifying prompt P.

So in summary, pivotal inversion provides an efficient optimization anchor, while null-text optimization preserves editability for prompt-based editing of inverted real images.

## High-Level Pseudo Code

 Here is the high-level pseudo code for the method proposed in this paper:

```python
# Pivotal Inversion
z_star = ddim_inversion(image, prompt, w=1) # Get pivot trajectory

# Null-Text Optimization
varnothing = initialize_to_null_embedding()
for t in reversed(T to 1):
  for i in range(N):
    varnothing = optimize(varnothing, z_star[t-1], prompt)  
  update_latent(z_[t-1], z_[t], varnothing, prompt)

# Editing
edited_prompt = modify_prompt(prompt) 
edited_image = sample(z_[T], edited_prompt, varnothing)
```

To summarize:

- Perform initial DDIM inversion with low guidance scale to get pivotal trajectory z_star

- Initialize null embedding varnothing 

- Optimize varnothing in reverse timestep order to reconstruct image

- Update latent code z_t-1 for next timestep

- Modify prompt and sample edited image using optimized z_T and varnothing

So we use pivotal inversion for efficiency and null-text optimization to retain editing capabilities when inverting real images. The inverted image can then be edited by modifying the text prompt.
```

## Detailed Pseudo Code

 Here is a more detailed pseudo code to implement the approach proposed in this paper:

```python
# Hyperparameters
T = number of diffusion steps 
w = guidance scale
N = number of opt steps per diffusion step

# Pivotal Inversion

def ddim_inversion(image, prompt, w):

  encode image to z_0

  z_T = sample Gaussian noise
  
  for t in T to 1:
    z_t = denoise(z_{t+1}, prompt, w) 
  return [z_T, ..., z_0]

z_star = ddim_inversion(image, prompt, w=1)

# Null-Text Optimization

def optimize(varnothing, z_star, prompt):
  
  z_t = add_noise(z_{t+1}, prompt, varnothing) 
  
  loss = ||z_t - z*_t||
  
  update varnothing to minimize loss
  
  return varnothing

varnothing_T = initialize_to_null_embedding() 

for t in T to 1:

  z_t = z_star[t]
  
  for i in range(N):
  
    varnothing_t = optimize(varnothing_t, z_t, prompt)

  varnothing_{t-1} = varnothing_t

  z_{t-1} = add_noise(z_t, prompt, varnothing_t)

# Editing

edited_prompt = modify_prompt(prompt)

z_T = sample_Gaussian_noise() 

for t in 1 to T:

  z_{t-1} = denoise(z_t, edited_prompt, varnothing_t) 

edited_image = decode(z_0)

return edited_image
```

In summary, pivotal inversion provides the z_star trajectory which is used as the optimization target in null-text optimization to accurately reconstruct the image while retaining editability. The optimized varnothing is then used at inference for text-guided editing by modifying the prompt.
